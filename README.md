# time2sleep

A smart alarm clock system built with Python and MQTT, which wakes you up during light sleep, in a user-defined time window.
The system runs on a Raspberry Pi and has a few sensors to collect environmental and sleep data, which is then uploaded to ThingSpeak and can be viewed on a Freeboard dashboard.
